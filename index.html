      When I purchased my URL I wasn't sure what to do with it, at the time
      I picked it up only because it was available. After I tore the ligaments
      in my ankle while being unemployed during the COVID-19 outbreak I found
      myself needing something to keep me mentally engaged. In college I dabbled
      with website development and remembered it as being something that I enjoy.
      I started taking a few classes here and there and tried out a Udacity course
      (waste of money).

      In the famous words of Steve Jobs, "Real artists ship." Being that I was
      sitting on my URL I decided it was time to ship my projects to the market.
      While I am a long way from another Steve Jobs quote, "Click. Boom. Amazing!",
      I'm getting better and as my skills evolve so will my this page.
